## 📖 Overview
This project is a **web-based CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) Risk Stratification System** that integrates with **hospital databases** to monitor and **flag high-risk patients** based on eGFR, UACR, and other critical lab results. 

The application provides **clinicians with actionable insights**, reducing **alert fatigue** while improving **early CKD detection and patient management**.

## 🔥 Key Features
### 🏥 **Patient Management**
- 📋 **Dynamic Patient List** → Displays **recent test results, risk levels, and patient details**.
- 🚨 **Smart Alert System** → Flags patients with **critical eGFR/UACR levels** tested in the last **24 hours**.
- 📊 **Trend Analysis** → Provides **interactive graphs** showing **eGFR and UACR progression over time**.

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Support**
- 💬 **Clinician Chatbot** → Assists **non-specialist doctors** by explaining **risk levels** and **suggesting next steps**.
- 📡 **Integrated with Hospital Databases** → Ensures **real-time patient updates**.

### 🚨 **Risk-Based Alerting**
- 🔴 **Critical Risk (eGFR < 30, UACR > 300)** → Immediate attention required.
- 🟠 **High Risk (eGFR 30-59, UACR 150-300)** → Close monitoring needed.
- 🟡 **Moderate Risk (eGFR 60-89, UACR 30-150)** → Regular follow-up suggested.
- 🟡 **Acknowledged Critical Patients** → Previously flagged patients under monitoring.

### 🏥 **Medical History & Decision Support**
- ✅ Tracks **kidney transplants and medical history**.
- 📊 Displays **historical test results** to **predict CKD progression**.
- 🛠 Supports **clinicians in decision-making** by offering **evidence-based insights**.
